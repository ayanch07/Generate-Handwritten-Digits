# Generate-Handwritten-Digits

### Project Statement
To train a Generative Adversial Network to generate handwritten digits (0 to 9) using the MSINT data.

### Project Description
The concept of GANs is based on the "indirect" training through the discriminator, which itself is also being updated dynamically. This basically means that the generator is not trained to minimize the distance to a specific image, but rather to fool the discriminator. This enables the model to learn in an unsupervised manner.
This project aims to develop a introductory understanding of GANs.
